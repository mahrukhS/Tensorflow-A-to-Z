## Module 2: Core Learning Algorithms

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this Module, we will learn about a few core learning algorithms which include: 
1. Linear Regression
2. Classification
3. Clustering
4. Hidden Markov Models
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will learn the following for these models:
1. How the model works
2. Exploratory Data Analysis to get insights on data
3. Understanding model parameters such as epochs and batch size
4. Creating an Input format for each model type
5. Building the model
6. Training the model
7. Evaluating the model
8. Making Predictions
